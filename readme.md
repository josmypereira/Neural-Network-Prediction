# üè† Neural Network House Price Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project develops a **Neural Network (NN)** model to predict house sale prices using various features, such as garage size, living area, and overall quality. The goal is to provide a robust predictive model for continuous house price values.

## üìã Data Description
The dataset includes several features relevant to house pricing:
- **4 numerical variables** used in the model:
  - Garage Cars
  - Garage Area
  - Overall Quality
  - Ground Living Area
- Additional potential features include property age, neighborhood ratings, and additional amenities, which can improve model performance if included.

### Sample Data Structure
| Variable Name      | Description                           | Sample Data         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Garage Cars        | Number of cars the garage can hold    | 2; 3; ...           |
| Garage Area        | Area of the garage (in sqft)         | 600; 750; ...       |
| Overall Quality    | Quality rating of the house          | 5; 7; ...           |
| Ground Living Area | Living area size on ground floor (sqft) | 2200; 2800; ... |

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA included:
1. **Correlation Analysis**: Identified key variables highly correlated with house prices.
2. **Feature Visualization**: Analyzed the impact of various features (e.g., garage area, living space) on pricing.
3. **Outlier Detection**: Assessed outliers to reduce potential model skew.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preprocessing
- **Removed Irrelevant Columns**: Dropped irrelevant features such as IDs and redundant information.
- **Train-Test Split**: Divided data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
- **Feature Scaling**: Scaled features to ensure consistency and optimize model performance.

## üöÄ Model Training and Evaluation
The NN model was structured as follows:
- **Input Layer**: Accepts 4 input features.
- **Hidden Layers**:
  - **Layer 1**: 64 nodes
  - **Layer 2**: 32 nodes
- **Activation**: ReLU in hidden layers, linear in output.
- **Output Layer**: Single node with continuous sale price predictions.

### Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated on key metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-Squared** value

These metrics provide insight into the model‚Äôs accuracy and generalization capability.

## üìä Results and Prediction Example
Given the input features:
- **Garage Cars**: 2
- **Garage Area**: 600 ft¬≤
- **Overall Quality**: 7
- **Ground Living Area**: 2,200 ft¬≤

The model forecasts a **predicted sale price** based on historical data patterns. This prediction aligns with expected market trends, where higher quality and larger living areas typically yield higher prices.

| Metric               | Value            |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Mean Absolute Error**     | $25,000       |
| **Mean Squared Error**      | 1.2e+10       |
| **R-Squared**               | 0.80          |

## üìà Sensitivity Analysis: Impact on Net Profit
A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess how variations in features (e.g., increasing garage area or quality) affect predicted sales prices and net profit. Simulations show which features most impact profitability, guiding investment decisions (e.g., adding a garage or increasing living space).

## üõ†Ô∏è Limitations and Improvements
1. **Data Quality**: Model accuracy depends on data quality. Inadequate or biased data limits predictive performance.
2. **Model Complexity**: Overly complex models risk overfitting, impacting generalization.
3. **Interpretability**: NNs can be "black-box" models, making feature importance challenging to interpret.

### Potential Solutions
- **Data Augmentation**: Incorporate additional data sources (e.g., neighborhood ratings) to improve accuracy.
- **Regularization**: Techniques like dropout or L2 regularization can reduce overfitting.
- **Model Comparison**: Complement the NN with simpler models (e.g., linear regression) for interpretability.
